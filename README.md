sass-strap
================

sass-strap is a modification of [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) which is ready to use with [prepros](alphapixels.com/prepros).

It comes with a preconfigured config.rb file where you can specify the directories where your sass files and sprites will be compiled to, it also has a dehashing function in order to remove the hash of the generated sprite.
